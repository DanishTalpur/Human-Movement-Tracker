3. Ensure notebooks do not contain secrets or large outputs
4. Open a pull request and describe your changes

Guidelines:
- Keep code readable with meaningful names
- Avoid committing datasets, model weights, or generated media
- Prefer small, focused PRs with context and screenshots (when relevant)
